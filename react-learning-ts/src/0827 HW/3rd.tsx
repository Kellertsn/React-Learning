// 1. What was different about your previous projects?
// Each project had different focus areas — some were more about frontend user experience, others about backend data handling or integration. I adapted to the scope and priorities of each.

// 2. Do you have any exposure or interactions with end users?
// Yes, mostly through user feedback sessions and reports from product managers.

// 2a. Do you get feedback from them?
// Yes, feedback often came through surveys or bug reports, and we used it to refine features and improve usability.

// 3. Steps to ensure security and avoid issues?
// Input validation, sanitizing data, authentication/authorization, HTTPS, secure cookies, and dependency checks.

// 4. Passion / preference frontend vs fullstack?
// I enjoy frontend most because it’s user-facing and creative, but I’m comfortable doing fullstack when needed.

// 5. Interactions with designers?
// I usually work closely with them, reviewing mockups, asking clarifying questions, and implementing designs while keeping performance and feasibility in mind.

// 6. Build reusable vs use existing vs from scratch?
// I evaluate scope, complexity, and deadlines. If something exists and fits, I reuse it. If not, I build.
// 6a. Downside of reusability?
// Too much abstraction can make components hard to maintain or overcomplicated.

// 7. Feelings on JavaScript and TypeScript?
// JavaScript is flexible; TypeScript adds safety and clarity.
// 7a. Trade-off of TypeScript?
// Yes, it can slow down small solo projects.
// 7b. Worth it?
// For team projects and long-term code, yes — the benefits outweigh the slower start.

// 8. Where to add unit tests?
// Critical logic, data transformations, and bug fixes — places where errors would be costly.

// 9. Cypress / automated tests?
// I use Cypress for end-to-end user flows; automated unit tests for core functions.

// 10. Collaborating with engineers?
// Code reviews, pair programming, regular standups, and shared documentation.

// 11. Feedback examples?
// I’ve received feedback on code readability and incorporated naming/style changes. I also give peers constructive suggestions during reviews.

// 12. Monitoring applications?
// Use logs, performance metrics, and monitoring tools to track errors and latency.

// 13. Experience with Sentry.io?
// Yes, helpful for catching runtime errors in production with stack traces and user context.

// 14. What drives you towards working with Tesla?
// I admire Tesla’s mission, innovation, and impact — I want to contribute to products that matter on a global scale.

// 15. Do you have any questions?
// Yes — I’d ask about the team structure, the development workflow, and what Tesla values most in engineers on this team.
